Q1
Reward function=-1.0*th**2-0.1*thdot**2-0.001*u**2 in py
here th is angle with vertical axis considering if rod is vertically upward angle is 0
thdot is angular velocity and u is torque 

Q2
If we decrease constant curresponding to velocity term then the stability of policy decreases

and If we increase the constant curresponding to angle offset policy gradient decreases which also makes policy bad and it's determination more time consuming

If we do both together obviously optimal policy will become bad and difficult to find


Q3
If we addd another term to support rightward angular velocity policy become more unstable i.e simply aur quality of aur optimal policy decreases.
